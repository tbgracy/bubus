# 🚍 Bubus 🚍

<center> <img src='bubus.png'/> </center>

A web app that allows you to find the bus from point A to point B in some towns of Madagascar.

## 🤔 Why

Finding the right bus when you're just moving in a new town is kind of frustrating. Unfortunately, bus data in Madagascar is somewhat hard to find BUT hopefully some awesome devs already made available some data to start with (Shout out to [leorak98](), [selestino](), [j03-dev](https://github.com/j03-dev))

## 🏙️ Curently available towns
